## Security Measures & Data Protection

DevSec Shield implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect your data and ensure the highest level of application security:

### File Security

* **Antivirus Scanning**: All file uploads are automatically scanned for malware before processing
* **File Size Limits**: Individual file uploads are limited to prevent resource exhaustion
* **Secure File Handling**: Files are processed in isolated, temporary environments

### Application Security

* **OWASP Top 10 Compliance**: DevSec Shield has been thoroughly tested against OWASP Top 10 for API Security vulnerabilities
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enhanced security for login and signup with 2FA verification
* **Secure Authentication**: JWT tokens and encrypted session management
* **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks
* **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure service availability

### Data Privacy & Protection

* **No Sensitive Data Storage**: Repository source code, API keys, and Personal Access Tokens submitted to the application are never stored permanently
* **Temporary Processing Only**: Sensitive data is used solely to initiate scans and is immediately purged after analysis completion
* **Minimal Data Retention**: Only essential metadata is retained for record-keeping (repository URLs, scan names, timestamps)
* **Encrypted Data Transmission**: TLS 1.3 encryption for all communications
* **Secure Cloud Infrastructure**: Regular security audits and compliance certifications

### Additional Security Features

* **Automated Security Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and monitoring
* **Regular Penetration Testing**: Certified security professionals perform regular security assessments
* **Access Controls**: Role-based access control and user permission management
